    "What is angiography?": (
        "Angiography is the x-ray study of the blood vessels. It uses a radiopaque substance, or dye, to make the blood vessels visible under x-ray imaging. A specific type of angiography, called arteriography, involves the study of arteries."
    ),
    "What is the purpose of angiography?": (
        "Angiography is used to detect abnormalities or blockages in blood vessels, known as occlusions, throughout the circulatory system and in some organs. It helps identify atherosclerosis, diagnose heart disease, evaluate kidney function, detect kidney cysts or tumors, and diagnose aneurysms, tumors, blood clots, or arteriovenous malformations in the brain. It is also used to assess retinal problems and provide accurate maps of the heart or brain for surgeries."
    ),
    "What are the precautions to consider before undergoing angiography?": (
        "Patients with kidney disease or injury may experience further kidney damage from the contrast mediums used in angiography. People with blood clotting issues, allergies to contrast mediums, or iodine should avoid the procedure. Pregnant women are also advised against angiography due to the risks of ionizing radiation exposure to the fetus."
    ),
    "What happens during an angiography procedure?": (
        "Angiography is typically performed in a hospital by a trained radiologist, assisted by a technician or nurse, in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite. During the procedure, the patient's vital signs are monitored closely."
    ),
    "What is angiography and what is its purpose?": (
        "Angiography is the x-ray study of blood vessels using a radiopaque dye to make them visible under x-ray imaging. It is used to detect blockages or abnormalities, diagnose conditions such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, kidney issues, aneurysms, and brain malformations, and assist in pre-surgical mapping of the heart and brain."
    ),
    "What precautions should be taken before angiography, and what happens during the procedure?": (
        "Patients with kidney disease, clotting disorders, or allergies to contrast mediums or iodine should avoid angiography, and pregnant women should refrain from the procedure due to radiation risks. The procedure is carried out in a hospital's x-ray or fluoroscopy suite by a radiologist with assistance, while the patient's vital signs are monitored."

    "What is anosmia?": (
        "Anosmia is the lack or loss of the sense of smell. It may also refer to a decreased sense of smell. People with anosmia may mistakenly believe they also have ageusia (loss of taste), even though they can still distinguish basic tastes like salt, sweet, sour, and bitter."
    ),
    "What causes anosmia?": (
        "The most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlusion due to rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal membranes), which prevents air from reaching the olfactory nerves. Other causes include nasal polyps, head injuries, certain viral infections, and even tumors. Irritants like allergens, cigarette smoke, and pollutants may also contribute to anosmia."
    ),
    "What are the symptoms of anosmia?": (
        "The primary symptom of anosmia is the inability to smell. Patients may also report a distorted or altered sense of smell, such as intensified or hallucinatory smells, which may indicate a brain malfunction."
    ),
    "How is anosmia diagnosed?": (
        "A physician typically tests each nostril separately with common non-irritating odors like perfume or coffee. Imaging studies may be necessary to detect underlying causes such as brain injury, sinus infections, or tumors."
    ),
    "What treatments are available for anosmia?": (
        "The first step in treating anosmia is quitting smoking, as many smokers who quit regain their sense of smell. Addressing nasal irritants, respiratory allergies, and chronic infections can also be helpful. Corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation. In cases of nasal polyps, surgery may be necessary."
    ),
    "What is the alternative treatment for anosmia?": (
        "Alternative treatments focus on identifying and addressing the underlying cause. For example, treating rhinitis with herbal decongestants or mast cell stabilizers can help. Other treatments may include nasal steam with essential oils, naso-specific therapy, and botanical medicine. In cases of olfactory nerve damage, recovery is difficult, but homeopathic medicine may help with smell distortions."
    ),
    "What is the prognosis for anosmia?": (
        "If the cause of anosmia is nasal inflammation, recovery is often excellent. However, if the cause is nerve damage, the chances of recovery are much lower, and regaining the sense of smell may be difficult."
    ),
    "What is anosmia and what are its causes and treatments?": (
        "Anosmia is the loss or decreased sense of smell. It is commonly caused by nasal issues like rhinitis or nasal polyps, as well as head injuries or viral infections. Treatments include quitting smoking, corticosteroids, and addressing underlying causes like allergies. Alternative treatments focus on herbal remedies, nasal therapies, and lifestyle changes."

Recovery depends on whether the cause is inflammation or nerve damage."
    ),
    "what is alopecia?": (
        "Alopecia is a term that refers to hair loss, or baldness. It can occur for various reasons, ranging from natural causes to underlying health problems. The pattern of hair loss and the condition of the scalp can help diagnose the cause."

    ),
    "What should I do if I have bald patches?": (
        "If you're experiencing bald patches, it's important to first consult with a dermatologist to determine the cause. Treatment options vary based on the underlying cause and may include medications like minoxidil, finasteride, or addressing conditions like fungal infections, or even exploring hair transplantation methods if necessary."
    ),
    "How is alopecia diagnosed?": (
        "Alopecia is diagnosed primarily by a dermatologist based on the pattern of hair loss. For more obscure causes, a skin biopsy or additional tests may be required to identify underlying systemic conditions."
    ),
    "What treatments are available for alopecia?": (
        "Treatment for alopecia depends on its cause. Options include medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar) for conditions like androgenic alopecia, treating underlying causes like fungal infections or systemic diseases, or surgical options like hair transplantation or scalp reduction."
    ),
    "What is male pattern baldness?": (
        "Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is the most common form of hair loss in men. It is characterized by hair thinning on the top and front of the head, while the scalp remains healthy."
    ),
    "Can alopecia be cured?": (
        "The prognosis for alopecia varies. Some forms of hair loss can be treated and reversed, such as male pattern baldness with medications or hair transplantation. However, if nerve or permanent damage is the cause, hair may not regrow."
    ),
    "What are some alternative treatments for alopecia?": (
        "Alternative treatments for alopecia may include naturopathic approaches like herbal decongestants, essential oil nasal steams, or homeopathic medicine. However, efficacy varies and it is important to address the underlying cause."
